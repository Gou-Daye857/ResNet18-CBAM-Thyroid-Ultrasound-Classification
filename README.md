# ResNet18-CBAM-Thyroid-Ultrasound-Classification
## Dataset
We use the publicly available TN5000 thyroid ultrasound dataset introduced by Huan Zhang et al. in  
[TN5000: An Ultrasound Image Dataset for Thyroid Nodule Detection and Classification](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05757-4).
## Framework
We enhance ResNet by incorporating the CBAM attention module to improve classification performance.
